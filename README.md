# CCS3: Cognitive Processing and Detection of AI-Generated and Human-Written Text

This repository contains the codes and datasets of a group project for the course **Computational Cognitive Science 3 (CCS3)**.  
This project consists of two studies including **Study 1: Eye-tracking Study on Human and AI Texts** and **Study 2: A Multimodal Classification Baseline Study**.

## Segemented Reading Texts

This folder contains the reading material for this eye-tracking study including 8 AI texts and 8 human-written texts. Because Chinese do not have spaces between words, in these texts, we added spaces between words to make it easier for TobiiPro Lab to detect Area of Interests (AOIs).

## Raw Data

The file `raw_data.zip` contains **all original eye-tracking experiment data** collected in this project through TobiiPro Lab. We have already anonymized all the dataset. 

Please **download and unzip** the file before using the data.

## Study 1 Tasks

**Study 1: Eye-tracking Study on Human and AI Texts** focuses on analyzing eye-tracking data to investigate whether reading behavior differs between human-written and AI-generated texts.

This folder contians two datasets extracted from the "Raw Data" to analyze research questions in Study 1. We also attch the code for data analysis and the code for calculating the textual similarity between AI and Human texts.

## Study 2 Tasks

For **Study 2: A Multimodal Classification Baseline Study**, we provide two sub-tasks.  
Please refer to the corresponding README files for details:

- **ET-Net (eye-tracking model baseline)**:  
  [ET-Net-readme.md](Study_2/ET-Net/README.md)

- **LLM-based baseline**:
