## Study 1 Tasks

**Study 1: Eye-tracking Study on Human and AI Texts** focuses on analyzing eye-tracking data to investigate whether reading behavior differs between human-written and AI-generated texts.  
This part of the project mainly involves data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and visualization of eye-movement features.
